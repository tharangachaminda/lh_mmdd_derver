Keywords: ["division", "times tables", "7 times table"]
```

### Medium Level Example:

```
Question: "A rectangular garden is 12 metres long and 8 metres wide. What is its area?"
Answer: 96
Explanation: "Area of rectangle = length √ó width = 12 m √ó 8 m = 96 square metres (or 96 m¬≤)"
Keywords: ["area", "rectangle", "square metres", "multiplication"]
```

### Hard Level Example:

```
Question: "Emma bought 5 books for $8.75 each and 3 pens for $1.25 each. What was the total cost?"
Answer: 47.50
Explanation: "Books: 5 √ó $8.75 = $43.75. Pens: 3 √ó $1.25 = $3.75. Total: $43.75 + $3.75 = $47.50"
Keywords: ["multiplication", "addition", "money", "multi-step", "word problem"]
