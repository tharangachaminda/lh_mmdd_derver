## Example Usage

1. Choose appropriate question types for your target grade
2. Create questions following the JSON template structure
3. Ensure proper difficulty distribution (40% easy, 40% medium, 20% hard)
4. Validate questions using the validation script
5. Ingest into vector database using the ingestion script

## Validation Command

```bash
node validate-and-ingest-questions.mjs --file your-questions.json
```

This will validate the structure and mathematical content before storing in the vector database.
