# Math Learning Hub - Project Plan and Dev Log

A math learning application backend powered by LLM for elementary school students, focusing on interactive and adaptive question generation.

## Structure

Units are organized chronologically with clear objectives:

-   01: Project Setup - Basic infrastructure and testing setup
-   02: Question Generation - Core question generation service
-   Upcoming units focus on LLM integration and API development

## About the Project

### What This Is

An intelligent math learning platform that:

-   Generates age-appropriate math questions using LLM
-   Adapts difficulty based on student performance
-   Provides contextual learning using curriculum standards
-   Supports multiple question types and learning paths

## Units Implemented

### Completed Units

-   **01**: Project Setup - Basic project infrastructure and testing setup
-   **02**: Question Generation - Core question generation service implementation

### Units In Progress

#### 03. LangChain Integration

**Status:** Planning Phase

-   Designing LLM integration
-   Preparing question templates
-   Planning curriculum context integration

## Planned Units

-   **03**: OpenSearch Integration - Vector database setup and RAG implementation
-   **04**: API Layer - RESTful endpoints and validation
-   **05**: Learning Workflows - LangGraph implementation
-   **06**: Testing & Documentation - Comprehensive testing and API docs
-   **07**: Deployment & Monitoring - Production setup and monitoring

## Development Approach

Following Test-Driven Development (TDD) with MMDD methodology:

1. Write failing tests first
2. Implement minimum code to pass
3. Update unit tests accordingly
4. If you feel it takes long time to fix a unit test implement that unit test from scratch
5. Refactor while maintaining coverage
6. Document decisions and next steps
