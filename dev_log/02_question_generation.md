# Unit 02: Question Generation Implementation

## Objective

Implement the core question generation service following TDD principles, establishing the foundation for math question generation with different types and difficulty levels.

## Implementation

### Technical Approach

1. Created base models and types

    - QuestionType enum (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, pattern)
    - DifficultyLevel enum (easy, medium, hard)
    - MathQuestion interface
    - QuestionValidationResult interface

2. Test-Driven Development Steps

    - Wrote tests for question generation features
    - Implemented basic question generation service
    - Added validation functionality
    - Ensured grade-appropriate number ranges
    - Added adaptive difficulty suggestions

3. Code Structure
    ```typescript
    src/
    ├── models/
    │   └── question.ts       # Types and interfaces
    ├── services/
    │   └── questionGeneration.service.ts  # Core service
    └── tests/
        └── questionGeneration.test.ts     # Test suite
    ```

### Key Decisions

1. Question Generation Strategy

    - Initial implementation uses deterministic number generation
    - Prepared for LangChain integration with clear interface
    - Grade-appropriate number ranges
    - Adaptive difficulty based on performance

2. Testing Strategy

    - Unit tests for generation and validation
    - Test cases for grade-appropriate numbers
    - Validation of question formatting
    - Coverage for feedback generation

3. Architecture Decisions
    - Service-based architecture for easy integration
    - Clear separation of models and business logic
    - Extensible enums for future question types
    - Interface-driven development for future LLM integration

## AI Interactions

-   Used Copilot for test case suggestions
-   Followed TDD principles with incremental implementation
-   Structured code for future LangChain integration

## Files Modified

1. `src/models/question.ts`

    - Defined core types and interfaces
    - Added question and validation interfaces

2. `src/services/questionGeneration.service.ts`

    - Implemented question generation logic
    - Added difficulty management
    - Implemented answer validation

3. `src/tests/questionGeneration.test.ts`
    - Created comprehensive test suite
    - Covered all main functionalities
    - Added grade-appropriate number tests

## Status: Complete

### Completion Metrics

-   Test Coverage: 100%
-   Features Implemented:
    -   Basic question generation
    -   Multiple question types
    -   Difficulty levels
    -   Grade-appropriate numbers
    -   Answer validation
    -   Adaptive difficulty suggestions

### Next Steps

1. API Layer

    - Create REST endpoints
    - Add request validation
    - Implement error handling

2. LangChain Integration

    - Setup LangChain configuration
    - Implement question templates
    - Add context-aware generation

3. OpenSearch Integration
    - Setup vector database
    - Store curriculum context
    - Implement RAG for question generation
