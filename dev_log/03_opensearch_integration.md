# Unit 03: OpenSearch Integration

## Overview

This unit covers the implementation of OpenSearch as our vector database solution for storing and retrieving question embeddings.

## Implementation Details

### OpenSearch Service

-   Implemented `OpenSearchService` class in `src/services/opensearch.service.ts`
-   Core functionalities:
    -   Connection management with authentication
    -   Index initialization with vector mapping
    -   Vector operations (store, search, delete)
    -   Health checks and error handling

### Vector Search Operations

-   Implemented vector-based similarity search
-   Configurable index settings for vector fields
-   Support for cosine similarity scoring

### Testing Infrastructure

-   Comprehensive test suite with 100% coverage:
    -   Connection testing (`opensearch.connection.test.ts`)
    -   Vector operations testing (`opensearch.vector.test.ts`)
    -   General service testing (`opensearch.test.ts`)
-   Mock configurations for OpenSearch client
-   Error handling test cases

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies

```json
{
    "@opensearch-project/opensearch": "^3.2.0"
}
```

### Configuration

-   Authentication: Basic auth with admin credentials
-   SSL: Configurable SSL settings
-   Index settings:
    -   Vector dimension: 1536 (matches embedding size)
    -   Similarity algorithm: Cosine
    -   Vector field mapping for embeddings

## Testing Results

-   Connection tests: ✅ Passed
-   Vector operations: ✅ Passed
-   Error handling: ✅ Passed
-   Overall coverage: 100%

## Next Steps

1. Integrate with question generation service
2. Implement bulk operations for better performance
3. Add caching layer for frequently accessed questions
4. Implement monitoring and logging
