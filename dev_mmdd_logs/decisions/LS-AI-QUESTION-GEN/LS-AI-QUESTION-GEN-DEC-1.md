- Use traditional service orchestration
- **Pros**: Separation of concerns, moderate complexity
- **Cons**: Manual orchestration, limited intelligence

#### **Option 3: Full Agentic Workflow with LangGraph** ‚≠ê **SELECTED**
- Implement specialized AI agents for different tasks
- Use LangGraph for sophisticated workflow orchestration
- Create educational-specific agent roles
- **Pros**: Maximum sophistication, specialized expertise, scalable
- **Cons**: Higher complexity, longer implementation time
