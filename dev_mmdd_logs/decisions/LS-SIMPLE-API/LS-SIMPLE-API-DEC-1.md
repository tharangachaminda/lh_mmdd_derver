# Decision Record: Simplified Question Types API Architecture

**Decision ID**: LS-SIMPLE-API-DEC-1  
**Date**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED  
**Work Item**: LS-SIMPLE-API

## üéØ Context

The existing question generation system used a complex 25+ type enum system that was difficult for users to understand and use. Users had to know specific types like `DECIMAL_ADDITION_WITH_REGROUPING` or `TWO_DIGIT_MULTIPLICATION_WITH_CARRYING` to generate appropriate questions.

**Problems with Current System**:

-   Complex API requiring detailed knowledge of 25+ question types
-   Poor user experience for API consumers
-   Difficulty in maintaining and extending type system
-   No grade-level intelligence in type selection

## üîÑ Decision

**Implement a simplified 5-type API with intelligent sub-type selection**

### Core Design Principles:

1. **User Simplicity**: 5 main types that any educator understands
2. **Internal Flexibility**: Maintain existing granular sub-types internally
3. **Grade Intelligence**: Automatic sub-type selection based on grade level
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Keep existing agentic workflow unchanged

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decision

### 1. Main Question Types (User-Facing)

```typescript
enum MainQuestionType {
    ADDITION = "addition",
    SUBTRACTION = "subtraction",
    MULTIPLICATION = "multiplication",
    DIVISION = "division",
    PATTERN_RECOGNITION = "pattern_recognition",
}
```

### 2. Sub-Type System (Internal)

-   Keep existing 25+ granular sub-types
-   Create grade-based mapping system
-   Automatic selection based on user's grade input

### 3. API Design

```typescript
// Simple user request
{
  "types": ["addition", "subtraction"],
  "grade": 5,
  "difficulty": "medium"
}

// System automatically selects appropriate sub-types:
// Grade 5 addition ‚Üí decimal_addition, fraction_addition
// Grade 5 subtraction ‚Üí decimal_subtraction, fraction_subtraction
```

### 4. Implementation Components

-   `MainQuestionType` enum - 5 user-facing types
-   `QuestionSubType` enum - 25+ internal types
-   Grade-based mapping system
-   Zod validation schemas
-   New service layer with AI integration

## ‚úÖ Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Simplify Existing Types

**Option**: Reduce existing 25+ types to 10-15 types
**Rejected Because**: Still too complex for users, doesn't solve core UX problem

### Alternative 2: AI-Based Type Selection

**Option**: Let AI decide question types based on natural language
**Rejected Because**: Less predictable, harder to control, performance concerns

### Alternative 3: Complete System Rewrite

**Option**: Replace entire question generation system
**Rejected Because**: Too risky, would break existing integrations

### Alternative 4: Configuration-Based Approach ‚úÖ CHOSEN

**Option**: Simple main types with intelligent internal mapping
**Chosen Because**:

-   Best user experience (5 simple types)
-   Maintains internal flexibility
-   Backward compatible
-   Grade-intelligent
-   Extensible architecture

## üìä Implementation Details

### Grade-Based Sub-Type Selection Logic:

```typescript
// Grade 1-2: Basic operations only
grade <= 2 ‚Üí basic_addition, basic_subtraction

// Grade 3-4: Whole numbers, simple word problems
grade 3-4 ‚Üí whole_number_*, word_problem_*

// Grade 5+: Decimals, fractions, complex problems
grade >= 5 ‚Üí decimal_*, fraction_*, advanced_*
```

### Zod Integration:

-   Request validation with clear error messages
-   AI response parsing and validation
-   Type-safe throughout entire pipeline

### Service Architecture:

-   `SimplifiedQuestionService` - New service layer
-   Integrates with existing `LanguageModelFactory`
-   Maintains compatibility with agentic workflow

## üéØ Benefits Achieved

### User Experience:

-   **80% Reduction in API Complexity**: 5 types vs 25+ types
-   **Intuitive Interface**: Educators understand main types immediately
-   **Grade Intelligence**: System handles complexity automatically

### Developer Experience:

-   **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript + Zod validation
-   **Clear API**: Simple request format with rich response metadata
-   **Error Handling**: Structured validation with helpful messages

### System Architecture:

-   **Backward Compatible**: Existing systems unaffected
-   **Extensible**: Easy to add new main types or sub-types
-   **Maintainable**: Clear separation between user interface and internal logic

## üß™ Validation Results

### API Testing:

-   ‚úÖ All 5 main types generate appropriate questions
-   ‚úÖ Grade-based sub-type selection working correctly
-   ‚úÖ Mixed type requests handled properly
-   ‚úÖ Error handling validates correctly

### Performance:

-   **Generation Time**: 6-14 seconds (AI model dependent)
-   **Type Selection**: Instant (grade-based mapping)
-   **Validation**: Fast Zod schema validation

### Integration:

-   ‚úÖ Existing agentic workflow unchanged
-   ‚úÖ New endpoints alongside existing ones
-   ‚úÖ Shared infrastructure (models, database, AI services)

## üîÆ Future Considerations

### Extensibility:

-   Easy to add new main types (e.g., "geometry", "algebra")
-   Grade-based mappings can be refined based on user feedback
-   Sub-types can be expanded without API changes

### Performance Optimization:

-   Caching of grade-based mappings
-   Batch generation optimization
-   AI prompt engineering improvements

### Advanced Features:

-   Custom context themes (money, sports, science)
-   Difficulty calibration based on user feedback
-   Learning path recommendations
