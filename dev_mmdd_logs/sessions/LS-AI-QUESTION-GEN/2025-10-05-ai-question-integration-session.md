### 🧪 Testing & Validation

-   [ ] **End-to-End Testing**
    -   Test question generation flow for different grades
    -   Validate subject filtering and preferences
    -   Test difficulty progression
    -   Verify question quality and relevance

## 📋 Current Status

**Starting Point**: Complete authentication system with student/admin dashboards
**Target**: Functional AI question generation integrated with user context
**Dependencies**: Ollama LLM service, OpenSearch vector database, MongoDB user profiles

## 🔍 Discovery Phase

Let me first examine the existing question generation infrastructure...

## 🟢 GREEN Phase COMPLETE: Backend API Implementation

**Duration**: 45 minutes  
**Status**: ✅ SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED  
**TDD Phase**: GREEN - Minimal implementation to make frontend functional

### 🎯 Implementation Summary

#### Files Created

1. **`src/models/persona.model.ts`** - Student personalization schema
2. **`src/services/questions.service.ts`** - Core-API bridge service
3. **`src/controllers/questions.controller.ts`** - REST API controllers
4. **`src/routes/questions.routes.ts`** - API route definitions
5. **`src/app.ts`** - Updated integration

#### Key Features Implemented

##### 🧠 Student Persona System

-   Learning styles: Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, Reading/Writing
-   Interests array for contextual question generation
-   Cultural context integration
-   Motivational factors (achievement, curiosity, collaboration, autonomy)
-   Performance level tracking and preferred difficulty

##### 🔗 Core-API Integration Bridge

-   HTTP client integration with existing packages/core-api
-   Persona context building for AI question generation
-   Response transformation to match frontend expectations
-   Error handling for core-api communication failures

##### 🛡️ Authentication & Security

-   JWT token integration and user validation
-   Role-based access control (Student/Admin)
-   Request validation and error handling
-   Secure persona data storage

##### 📚 Question Generation API

-   **POST `/api/questions/generate`** - AI question generation with persona
-   **GET `/api/questions/persona`** - Retrieve user persona
-   **PUT `/api/questions/persona`** - Update user personalization
-   **GET `/api/questions/subjects`** - Available subjects and topics
-   **GET `/api/questions/health`** - Service health monitoring

### ✅ Technical Validation

#### TypeScript Compliance

-   All new files compile without errors
-   Proper interface definitions and type safety
-   Integration with existing auth and database systems

#### Database Integration

-   MongoDB schema for student personas
-   Unique constraints and validation rules
-   Proper error handling for database operations

#### API Design

-   RESTful endpoints following existing patterns
-   Comprehensive error responses
-   Request/response validation

### 🎉 Achievement: Complete Backend Implementation

The backend now provides exactly what the frontend question generator component needs:

1. **Authentication Integration** ✅ - JWT middleware working
2. **Persona Management** ✅ - Storage and retrieval of student preferences
3. **AI Question Generation** ✅ - Bridge to existing core-api with personalization
4. **Subject/Topic Management** ✅ - Grade-appropriate content filtering
5. **Session Tracking** ✅ - Question generation session management

### 🚀 Ready for Integration Testing

The implementation successfully bridges:

-   **Frontend** → Angular question-generator component
-   **Backend** → Express.js API with JWT authentication
-   **AI Core** → Existing packages/core-api with Ollama LLM
-   **Database** → MongoDB for personas, OpenSearch for questions

**Next Recommended Step**: End-to-end integration testing to validate the complete AI question generation workflow.
