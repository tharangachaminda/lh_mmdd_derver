# MMDD Session Log: LS-AI-QUESTION-GEN / 2025-10-07

## Objective

Enhance navigation button styling in the AI Question Generator QUESTIONS step using Angular Material design styles for improved accessibility and modern UI.

## TDD Cycle

-   **RED Phase:** UI failed to render Material buttons/icons due to incorrect module imports.
-   **GREEN Phase:**
    -   Statically imported `MatButtonModule` and `MatIconModule` in `question-generator.ts`.
    -   Updated template to use `<button mat-stroked-button>` and `<button mat-raised-button>` with `<mat-icon>` for navigation controls.
    -   Verified Material buttons/icons render correctly and navigation remains functional.

## Technical Decisions

-   Used Angular Material for consistent, accessible button styling.
-   Placed navigation controls after answer options and before submit button for optimal user flow.
-   Ensured Material modules are statically imported in the component for template recognition.

## Audit Trail

-   Files modified: `question-generator.ts`, `question-generator.html`
-   All changes committed and validated in browser.
-   UI now displays Material-styled navigation buttons with icons in correct position.

## Next Steps

-   Optionally refine button colors, spacing, or add further Material enhancements.
-   Confirm test coverage remains â‰¥80% after UI changes.
-   Continue with further MMDD/TDD cycles as needed.
