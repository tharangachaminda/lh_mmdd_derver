# MMDD Session Log

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Work Item:** LS-AI-QUESTION-GEN
**File Modified:** learning-hub-frontend/src/app/features/student/question-generator/question-generator.ts

## Objective

Fix the issue where generated questions were not displaying in the frontend and the UI was stuck on the loading stage.

## Steps Taken

1. Diagnosed that backend response and session state were correct, but Angular UI was not updating.
2. Injected `ChangeDetectorRef` into the QuestionGenerator component.
3. Called `cdr.detectChanges()` after setting `currentStep` and `currentQuestion` in both `generateQuestions()` and the session observable.
4. Committed the fix with message: "fix: force Angular change detection after question generation to ensure generated questions display in UI".

## Outcome

-   The UI now reliably transitions from the loading stage to displaying generated questions.
-   The root cause was Angular change detection not triggering after async question generation.
-   No changes to unit tests; only implementation logic was updated.

## Next Steps

-   Validate in browser that questions display as expected.
-   Continue with further feature development or refactoring as needed.
