# MMDD Session Log: LS-AI-QUESTION-GEN / 2025-10-07

## Objective

Implement question navigation (pagination) in the AI Question Generator frontend using strict MMDD/TDD methodology.

## TDD Cycle

-   **RED Phase:** Added failing test for navigation (pagination) in `question-generator.spec.ts`.
-   **GREEN Phase:**
    -   Added minimal navigation logic (`goToNextQuestion`, `goToPreviousQuestion`) to `QuestionGenerator`.
    -   Updated all test instantiations to use mock `ChangeDetectorRef`.
    -   Updated mock questions to match `GeneratedQuestion` interface.
    -   All tests now pass.

## Technical Decisions

-   Chose minimal implementation for navigation to enforce strict TDD.
-   Used full mock objects for type safety and future extensibility.
-   Provided mock `ChangeDetectorRef` for all test instantiations.

## Audit Trail

-   All changes committed: `question-generator.ts`, `question-generator.spec.ts`
-   Commit message: "feat: minimal question navigation (pagination) logic and tests (MMDD/TDD GREEN phase)"

## Next Steps

-   Optionally proceed to REFACTOR phase for code/UI improvements.
-   Confirm test coverage â‰¥80% before marking feature complete.
