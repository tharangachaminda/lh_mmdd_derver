## üìä **Implementation Strategy**

### **Step 1: Data Analysis**

-   Extract and categorize existing 180 questions
-   Identify gaps in NZ Grade 5 curriculum coverage
-   Map fragments to proposed systematic categories

### **Step 2: File Reorganization**

-   Create question_bank/grade5/ directory structure
-   Consolidate related questions into systematic files
-   Standardize metadata and format

### **Step 3: Gap Filling**

-   Generate additional questions to reach 30-40 per category
-   Ensure balanced difficulty distribution
-   Maintain Grade 4 quality standards

### **Step 4: Validation & Integration**

-   Validate all reorganized questions
-   Test vector search performance
-   Update session logs and progress tracking

## üöÄ **Next Immediate Steps**

### **Step 1: Current Question Analysis**

-   **Duration**: ~30 minutes
-   **Action**: Analyze existing 180 Grade 5 questions by type and content
-   **Output**: Categorization map and gap analysis

### **Step 2: Directory Structure Setup**

-   **Duration**: ~15 minutes
-   **Action**: Create question_bank/grade5/ with systematic file structure
-   **Output**: Organized directory ready for question consolidation

### **Step 3: First Category Implementation**

-   **Duration**: ~45 minutes
