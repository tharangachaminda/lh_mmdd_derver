## 🔄 TDD CYCLE PROGRESS

### 🔴 **RED PHASE** - Step 1 ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective**: Create comprehensive failing test suite  
**Duration**: 25 minutes  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

#### Implementation Details

-   **File Created**: `src/tests/grade8.phase2a.dataset.test.ts`
-   **Test Coverage**: 24 comprehensive tests across 5 categories
-   **Test Categories**:
    1. **Dataset Structure Validation** (4 tests)
    2. **Time Conversion Questions** (5 tests)
    3. **Volume Conversion Questions** (5 tests)
    4. **Question Quality and Standards** (5 tests)
    5. **Educational Standards Compliance** (5 tests)

#### Test Validation Results

```bash
npm test -- src/tests/grade8.phase2a.dataset.test.ts
Result: ❌ 19 failed, ✅ 5 passed, 📊 24 total
Status: ✅ RED PHASE VERIFIED - All tests failing as expected
```

#### Key Test Coverage Areas
