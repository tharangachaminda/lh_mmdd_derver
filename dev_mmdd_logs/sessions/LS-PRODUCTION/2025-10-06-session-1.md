# LS-PRODUCTION Session - Production AI Question Generation Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-06  
**Work Item**: LS-PRODUCTION  
**Duration**: ~60 minutes  
**TDD Phase**: GREEN (Production Implementation)

## Session Objective

Implement production-grade AI question generation system:

1. Fix authentication integration for real students
2. Implement proper student persona management
3. Connect frontend to production backend endpoints
4. Test end-to-end student workflow
5. Ensure production-ready error handling and validation

## Previous Context

-   ✅ **Cleanup Complete**: Removed 64+ ingestion files, preserved vector data
-   ✅ **Demo Working**: AI generation functional with 86%+ quality scores
-   ✅ **Frontend Ready**: UI built with AI metrics display
-   ⚠️ **Gap**: Demo endpoint not suitable for production use

## Production Requirements

-   Real student authentication and authorization
-   Proper student persona persistence and management
-   Production error handling and validation
-   Secure endpoint access with JWT tokens
-   Frontend-backend integration with real user sessions
-   Performance optimization for student usage

## Quality Gates for Production
