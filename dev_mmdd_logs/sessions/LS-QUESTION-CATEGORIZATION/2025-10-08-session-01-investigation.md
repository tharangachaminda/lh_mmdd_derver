## üéØ Session Objective

Investigate the vector database and codebase to define proper/valid mathematics question types that:

1. Leverage the full richness of existing vector DB embeddings
2. Vary appropriately by grade level
3. Maximize effectiveness of LLM-powered question generation
4. Align with NZ Mathematics Curriculum

---

## üîç Phase 1: Current State Analysis

### 1.1 Existing Question Type Implementation

**Frontend Current State** (`question.model.ts`):

```typescript
export const GRADE_TOPICS: GradeTopics = {
    9: {
        mathematics: ["Algebra", "Geometry", "Statistics", "Linear Equations"],
        // ... limited implementation
    },
};
```

**Issues Identified**:

-   ‚ùå Only Grade 9 defined (system has Grades 3-8 data)
-   ‚ùå Topics too broad: "Algebra", "Geometry" (not specific enough for vector search)
-   ‚ùå No alignment with actual vector DB content
-   ‚ùå Current UI shows: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division (hardcoded, limited)

### 1.2 Vector Database Content Analysis

**Question Bank Structure**:

```
question_bank/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ grade3/ (6 files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ grade4/ (10 files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ grade5/ (5 files)

### 1.3 Question Data Structure Analysis

**Sample Question Structure** (Grade 3 Addition):

```json
{
    "id": "g3-ADDITION-easy-001",
    "question": "What is 12 + 7?",
    "answer": 19,
    "explanation": "Add the ones: 2 + 7 = 9. Add the tens: 1 + 0 = 1. Total = 19.",
    "type": "ADDITION",
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "grade": 3,
    "subject": "Mathematics",
    "curriculumTopic": "Number and Algebra",
    "curriculumSubtopic": "Addition within 100",
    "keywords": ["addition", "grade 3", "easy"],
    "contentForEmbedding": "What is 12 + 7? Add the ones: 2 + 7 = 9..."
}
```

**Sample Advanced Question** (Grade 6 Algebraic Equations):

```json
{
    "id": "g6-ALGEBRAIC_EQUATIONS-easy-001",
    "question": "Is this equation true or false: 3 + 5 = 8?",
    "answer": "True",
    "type": "ALGEBRAIC_EQUATIONS",
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "curriculumSubtopic": "Equality concepts",
    "keywords": ["equality", "true false", "equation"]
}
```

**Key Observations**:

-   ‚úÖ Questions have rich metadata (topic, subtopic, keywords)
-   ‚úÖ Embeddings include question + explanation (great for semantic search)
-   ‚úÖ Clear difficulty progression within each type
-   ‚úÖ Curriculum-aligned subtopics provide additional granularity

### 1.4 Current UI/UX Implementation

**Frontend Topic Selection** (from `question-generator.ts`):

```typescript
// Currently hardcoded to basic operations
availableTopics: string[] = [];  // Should be populated dynamically

onSubjectChange(): void {
  this.availableTopics = this.questionService.getAvailableTopics(
    this.selectedSubject,
    this.currentUser.grade
  );
}
```

**Current Behavior**:

-   User selects "Mathematics" ‚Üí Gets basic topics (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)
-   No grade-specific topic filtering
-   Doesn't leverage 54+ question types in vector DB
-   Vector search likely ineffective due to mismatch between UI topics and DB types

## üìä Phase 2: Gap Analysis

### 2.1 Problems with Current Implementation

| Issue                                   | Impact                                         | Severity  |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| UI only shows 4 basic operations        | Students can't access 50+ other question types | üî¥ High   |
| No grade-specific topics                | Grade 8 students see same topics as Grade 3    | üî¥ High   |
| Topic names don't match vector DB types | Vector search returns poor results             | üî¥ High   |
| GRADE_TOPICS only has Grade 9           | Grades 3-8 have no topic configuration         | üî¥ High   |
| Hardcoded topics in frontend            | Can't easily update or expand                  | üü° Medium |
| No curriculum alignment visibility      | Users don't see curriculum mapping             | üü° Medium |

### 2.2 Vector DB Utilization Gap

**Current State**:

-   User selects "Multiplication"
-   Backend generates question dynamically (bypasses vector DB richness)
-   Vector search used only for relevance scoring
-   90% of embedded questions never retrieved

**Desired State**:

-   User selects specific topic (e.g., "Algebraic Equations", "Financial Literacy")
-   Vector search finds semantically similar questions from embeddings
-   LLM generates variations of high-quality embedded content
-   Full utilization of 54 question types across 60+ JSON files
