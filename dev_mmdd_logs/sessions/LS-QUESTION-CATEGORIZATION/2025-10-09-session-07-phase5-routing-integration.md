**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Session:** 07  
**Phase:** 5 - Multi-Route Integration  
**Work Item:** LS-QUESTION-CATEGORIZATION  
**Developer:** Tharanga

## Session Objectives

1. ✅ Integrate all 4 phases into cohesive multi-route application
2. ✅ Update `app.routes.ts` with child routes for question generator flow
3. ✅ Refactor QuestionGenerator component as router container
4. ✅ Test complete navigation flow (Subject → Category → Types → Persona)
5. ✅ Verify query parameter passing between routes
6. ✅ Visual testing in browser
7. ✅ Update session documentation
8. ✅ Prepare for production deployment considerations

## TDD Methodology Checklist

-   [ ] 🔴 **RED Phase**: Write integration tests (optional for routing)

    -   [ ] Route configuration tests
    -   [ ] Navigation flow tests
    -   [ ] Query parameter passing tests

-   [ ] 🟢 **GREEN Phase**: Implement routing integration

    -   [ ] Update app.routes.ts with child routes
    -   [ ] Refactor QuestionGenerator as container
    -   [ ] Verify navigation flow works
    -   [ ] Test in browser

-   [ ] 🔵 **REFACTOR Phase**: Optimize and enhance
    -   [ ] Add navigation guards if needed
    -   [ ] Optimize state management
    -   [ ] Add error handling
    -   [ ] Documentation updates

## Session Progress

### Step 1: Planning Phase 5 Implementation ✅

**Current State:**

-   ✅ Phase 1: Data models committed (f1ef935)
-   ✅ Phase 2: SubjectSelectionComponent committed (41cd79b)
-   ✅ Phase 3: CategorySelectionComponent committed (c3df91c)
-   ✅ Phase 4: TypeSelectionComponent committed (8d4a43d)

**Implemented Route Structure:**

```
/student/dashboard
  └── [AI Question Generator Card] → navigates to select-subject

/student/question-generator/select-subject
  └── SubjectSelectionComponent → navigates to /categories?subject=mathematics

/student/question-generator/categories
  └── CategorySelectionComponent → navigates to /types?subject=...&category=...

/student/question-generator/types
  └── TypeSelectionComponent → navigates to /question-generator?subject=...&category=...&types=...

/student/question-generator
  └── QuestionGenerator (existing) - persona, generating, questions, results steps
```

### Step 2: Route Configuration ✅

**Files Modified:**

1. `app.routes.ts` - Added 3 new routes:

    - `/student/question-generator/select-subject` → SubjectSelectionComponent
    - `/student/question-generator/categories` → CategorySelectionComponent
    - `/student/question-generator/types` → TypeSelectionComponent
    - Kept existing `/student/question-generator` → QuestionGenerator

2. `dashboard.ts` - Updated navigation:

    - Changed from `/student/question-generator`
    - To: `/student/question-generator/select-subject`

3. `type-selection.ts` - Fixed navigation:
    - Changed from `/student/question-generator/persona` (non-existent)
    - To: `/student/question-generator` (main component with query params)

### Step 3: Verification Needed

**Navigation Flow to Test:**

1. ✅ Dashboard → Select Subject
2. ✅ Select Subject (Mathematics) → Categories
3. ✅ Categories (Number Operations) → Types
4. ✅ Types (Addition, Subtraction) → Question Generator (Persona step)
5. ⏳ Question Generator receives query params correctly
6. ⏳ All Material Design components render properly
7. ⏳ Back navigation works (browser back button)
