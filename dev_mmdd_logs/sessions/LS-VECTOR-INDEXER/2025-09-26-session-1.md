# MMDD Session Log - LS-VECTOR-INDEXER

**Session**: 2025-09-26-session-1.md  
**Work Item**: LS-VECTOR-INDEXER  
**Objective**: Implement curriculum data indexing into vector database  
**TDD Phase**: ðŸ”´ RED - Analysis Phase

## Session Overview

**Duration**: ~30 minutes  
**Developer**: [Developer]  
**Agent**: GitHub Copilot (dev-mmtdd)

## Current Status

-   **Branch**: feature/vector-indexer
-   **Project**: Math Learning Hub Backend
-   **Context**: Post Ollama migration, now implementing vector database indexing
-   **Target**: Save JSON curriculum data into OpenSearch vector database

## Objective Analysis

### Requirements

1. **JSON Sample Format**: Create sample curriculum data structure
2. **Vector Indexing**: Implement curriculum data saving to OpenSearch
3. **Embedding Generation**: Use Ollama (via factory) for text embeddings
4. **Data Structure**: Proper curriculum model with vector support

### Current Architecture Assessment

-   âœ… **OpenSearch Service**: Already exists with vector support
-   âœ… **CurriculumDataService**: Exists with basic structure
-   âœ… **Ollama Integration**: Available via LanguageModelFactory
-   âœ… **Vector Mappings**: OpenSearch configured for 1536-dim embeddings

### Files to Analyze

-   `src/services/curriculumData.service.ts` - Current curriculum service
-   `src/services/opensearch.service.ts` - Vector database operations
-   `src/models/curriculum.ts` - Data structure definitions
-   Tests for curriculum indexing functionality

## Analysis Phase 
âœ… COMPLETE - Analyzed existing curriculum data structures and services

Key findings:
- CurriculumDataService exists with storeCurriculumContent() method
- Uses factory pattern with ILanguageModel interface for flexibility
- CurriculumContent interface well-defined in curriculum.ts (134 lines)
- SampleQuestion and MathConcept structures already present  
- Sample JSON created with comprehensive Grade 2 addition curriculum
- OpenSearch vector database integration already in place

## RED Phase - Write Failing Tests
âœ… COMPLETE - Created comprehensive failing tests

Created: `src/tests/curriculum.indexing.test.ts`
Test categories:
- JSON Data Loading: loadCurriculumFromJSON(), validateCurriculumData()
- Embedding Generation: storeCurriculumContent() with vector embeddings
- Vector Search: searchSimilarContent() functionality
- Batch Processing: processCurriculumBatch() for multiple items

All 7 tests failing as expected:
- 3 utility functions not implemented (loadCurriculumFromJSON, validateCurriculumData, processCurriculumBatch)
- 4 tests failing due to missing Ollama server or missing methods

## GREEN Phase - Make Tests Pass
âœ… COMPLETE - All tests passing (7/7)

### Implementation Created:

**Utility Functions (`src/utils/curriculum.loader.ts`):**
- `loadCurriculumFromJSON()`: Loads and parses curriculum data from JSON with date conversion
- `validateCurriculumData()`: Comprehensive validation of curriculum data structure
- `processCurriculumBatch()`: Batch processing of multiple curriculum items with validation
- Error handling for file not found and JSON parsing errors

**Test Infrastructure:**
- Mock OpenSearch client with proper response mocking
- Mock language model service for embedding generation 
- Proper TypeScript types and enum usage (QuestionType.ADDITION, DifficultyLevel.EASY)
- 1536-dimension mock embeddings to match OpenSearch vector requirements

**Sample Data:**
- `curriculum-batch-sample.json`: 3 curriculum items (Grade 2 addition, subtraction, Grade 3 multiplication)
- Comprehensive data structure with concepts, questions, prerequisites, learning objectives

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed generateEmbedding() method to use factory pattern instead of direct LangChain service
- Enhanced error handling for ENOENT file system errors
- Proper Jest mock configuration for OpenSearch responses

Moving to REFACTOR phase...

## Step 2: TDD Red Phase - Write Failing Tests

**Objective**: Create failing tests for curriculum data indexing
**Duration**: ~15 minutes
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
