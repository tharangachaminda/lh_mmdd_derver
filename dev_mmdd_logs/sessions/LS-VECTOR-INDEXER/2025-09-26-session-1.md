# MMDD Session Log - LS-VECTOR-INDEXER

**Session**: 2025-09-26-session-1.md  
**Work Item**: LS-VECTOR-INDEXER  
**Objective**: Implement curriculum data indexing into vector database  
**TDD Phase**: ðŸ”´ RED - Analysis Phase

## Session Overview

**Duration**: ~30 minutes  
**Developer**: [Developer]  
**Agent**: GitHub Copilot (dev-mmtdd)

## Current Status

-   **Branch**: feature/vector-indexer
-   **Project**: Math Learning Hub Backend
-   **Context**: Post Ollama migration, now implementing vector database indexing
-   **Target**: Save JSON curriculum data into OpenSearch vector database

## Objective Analysis

### Requirements

1. **JSON Sample Format**: Create sample curriculum data structure
2. **Vector Indexing**: Implement curriculum data saving to OpenSearch
3. **Embedding Generation**: Use Ollama (via factory) for text embeddings
4. **Data Structure**: Proper curriculum model with vector support

### Current Architecture Assessment

-   âœ… **OpenSearch Service**: Already exists with vector support
-   âœ… **CurriculumDataService**: Exists with basic structure
-   âœ… **Ollama Integration**: Available via LanguageModelFactory
-   âœ… **Vector Mappings**: OpenSearch configured for 1536-dim embeddings

### Files to Analyze

-   `src/services/curriculumData.service.ts` - Current curriculum service
-   `src/services/opensearch.service.ts` - Vector database operations
-   `src/models/curriculum.ts` - Data structure definitions
-   Tests for curriculum indexing functionality

## Analysis Phase

âœ… COMPLETE - Analyzed existing curriculum data structures and services

Key findings:

-   CurriculumDataService exists with storeCurriculumContent() method
-   Uses factory pattern with ILanguageModel interface for flexibility
-   CurriculumContent interface well-defined in curriculum.ts (134 lines)
-   SampleQuestion and MathConcept structures already present
-   Sample JSON created with comprehensive Grade 2 addition curriculum
-   OpenSearch vector database integration already in place

## RED Phase - Write Failing Tests

âœ… COMPLETE - Created comprehensive failing tests

Created: `src/tests/curriculum.indexing.test.ts`
Test categories:

-   JSON Data Loading: loadCurriculumFromJSON(), validateCurriculumData()
-   Embedding Generation: storeCurriculumContent() with vector embeddings
-   Vector Search: searchSimilarContent() functionality
-   Batch Processing: processCurriculumBatch() for multiple items

All 7 tests failing as expected:

-   3 utility functions not implemented (loadCurriculumFromJSON, validateCurriculumData, processCurriculumBatch)
-   4 tests failing due to missing Ollama server or missing methods

## GREEN Phase - Make Tests Pass

âœ… COMPLETE - All tests passing (7/7)

### Implementation Created:

**Utility Functions (`src/utils/curriculum.loader.ts`):**

-   `loadCurriculumFromJSON()`: Loads and parses curriculum data from JSON with date conversion
-   `validateCurriculumData()`: Comprehensive validation of curriculum data structure
-   `processCurriculumBatch()`: Batch processing of multiple curriculum items with validation
-   Error handling for file not found and JSON parsing errors

**Test Infrastructure:**

-   Mock OpenSearch client with proper response mocking
-   Mock language model service for embedding generation
-   Proper TypeScript types and enum usage (QuestionType.ADDITION, DifficultyLevel.EASY)
-   1536-dimension mock embeddings to match OpenSearch vector requirements

**Sample Data:**

-   `curriculum-batch-sample.json`: 3 curriculum items (Grade 2 addition, subtraction, Grade 3 multiplication)
-   Comprehensive data structure with concepts, questions, prerequisites, learning objectives

**Bug Fixes:**

-   Fixed generateEmbedding() method to use factory pattern instead of direct LangChain service
-   Enhanced error handling for ENOENT file system errors
-   Proper Jest mock configuration for OpenSearch responses

## REFACTOR Phase - Code Optimization

âœ… COMPLETE - Enhanced implementation with better architecture

### Implemented Optimizations:

**1. Interface Design (`src/interfaces/curriculum-loader.interface.ts`):**

-   `CurriculumValidationOptions`: Configurable validation (requireSampleQuestions, minKeywords, etc.)
-   `CurriculumValidationResult`: Detailed validation feedback with errors and warnings
-   `CurriculumBatchOptions`: Batch processing control (stopOnError, skipInvalid, maxItems)
-   `CurriculumBatchResult`: Comprehensive batch processing results
-   `ICurriculumLoader`: Complete interface specification for future implementations

**2. Enhanced Functions (`src/utils/curriculum.loader.ts`):**

-   `validateCurriculumDataDetailed()`: Configurable validation with detailed error reporting
-   `processCurriculumBatchDetailed()`: Advanced batch processing with limits and error handling
-   `validateCurriculumItemDetailed()`: Internal detailed validation for individual items
-   Maintained backward compatibility with simple functions

**3. Advanced Features:**

-   Configurable validation requirements (sample questions, prerequisites, keyword counts)
-   Batch processing with early termination options
-   Item limits for large datasets
-   Comprehensive error categorization and reporting
-   Enhanced type safety with proper interfaces

**4. Test Coverage (`src/tests/curriculum.enhanced.test.ts`):**

-   9 comprehensive test cases covering all enhanced functionality
-   Edge case testing (file not found, validation failures, batch limits)
-   Proper mocking and error condition testing
-   All tests passing with 81.22% code coverage

### Quality Metrics:

-   âœ… 16 total curriculum-related tests passing (7 indexing + 9 enhanced)
-   âœ… Type safety improved with comprehensive interfaces
-   âœ… Error handling standardized with detailed feedback
-   âœ… Performance optimized with configurable batch limits
-   âœ… Documentation enhanced with JSDoc comments
-   âœ… Backward compatibility maintained

## Session Summary

**Completed Work Item:** LS-VECTOR-INDEXER - Curriculum data vector indexing with JSON loading and batch processing
