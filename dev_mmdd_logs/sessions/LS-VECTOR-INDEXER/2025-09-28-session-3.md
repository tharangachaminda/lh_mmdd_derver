# MMDD Session Log: LS-VECTOR-INDEXER

**Session**: 2025-09-28-session-3  
**Work Item**: LS-VECTOR-INDEXER  
**Developer**: Development Team  
**Duration**: TBD  
**TDD Phase**: RED → GREEN (New Feature Implementation)

## 🎯 **Session Objectives**

-   **Primary**: Implement vector database storage for Grade 5 questions
-   **Secondary**: Generate embeddings for semantic search capabilities
-   **Tertiary**: Create batch ingestion system for optimized questions

## 📋 **Session Context**

### **Previous Work Completed** ✅

-   Grade 5 questions with enhanced metadata structure
-   Vector-optimized question format created
-   Individual difficulty fields added to all 90 questions
-   Comprehensive documentation and validation completed

### **Current Challenge**

Need to store the optimized questions (`grade5-questions-vector-ready.json`) into OpenSearch vector database with proper embeddings and indexing.

## 🔍 **Analysis Phase**

### **Current OpenSearch Service Capabilities**

✅ Basic vector storage with 1536-dimensional embeddings  
✅ KNN search functionality  
✅ Difficulty and topic filtering  
✅ Connection testing and health checks

### **Gap Analysis**

❌ **Enhanced Metadata Support**: Current schema doesn't support rich curriculum metadata  
❌ **Batch Ingestion**: No bulk loading for 90 questions  
❌ **Embedding Generation**: No integration with language models  
❌ **Enhanced Search**: Missing support for grade, subject, learning objectives

## 🛠️ **Implementation Plan**

**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**TDD Phase**: RED (Write failing tests for embedding generation)

**Implementation Requirements**:

-   Integrate with Ollama/OpenAI for embedding generation
-   Use `contentForEmbedding` field as input
-   Handle batch processing for efficiency
-   Error handling and retry logic

### **Step 3: Batch Ingestion Script** 🔴 RED

**Objective**: Create script to load all 90 questions with embeddings
**Duration**: ~60 minutes

**Impact**: Complete loss of vector database investment

### **Step 5: Data Persistence Solution** 🟢 GREEN

**Objective**: Implement comprehensive data persistence and backup system
**Duration**: ~20 minutes  
**TDD Phase**: GREEN (Implement production-ready persistence)

#### **Implementation Completed** ✅

**Docker Compose Configuration**:

-   ✅ Configured `opensearch-data/` and `opensearch-logs/` directories
-   ✅ Added auto-restart and proper networking
-   ✅ Included OpenSearch Dashboards for data visualization

**Backup System**:

-   ✅ Created `backup-opensearch.sh` for automated backups
-   ✅ Timestamped backup directories in `./backups/`
-   ✅ Export index mappings, documents, and cluster settings
-   ✅ Generated restore scripts with each backup

**Documentation**:

-   ✅ Created `OPENSEARCH_PERSISTENCE.md` with complete setup guide
-   ✅ Migration instructions from current container setup
-   ✅ Monitoring and troubleshooting procedures

**Repository Protection**:

-   ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude data directories
-   ✅ Protected against committing large backup files

### **Data Safety Status** 🛡️

| Component        | Before       | After         | Status        |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| Data Persistence | ❌ Ephemeral | ✅ Persistent | **PROTECTED** |
| Backup System    | ❌ None      | ✅ Automated  | **AVAILABLE** |
| Recovery Plan    | ❌ None      | ✅ Documented | **READY**     |
| Production Ready | ❌ Risk      | ✅ Safe       | **SECURE**    |

### **Critical Commands for Data Safety**

```bash
# IMMEDIATE: Backup current data
./backup-opensearch.sh

# SETUP: Start persistent OpenSearch
docker-compose up -d

# RESTORE: Re-ingest data into persistent storage
node store-questions-direct.mjs

# VERIFY: Confirm all 90 questions restored
node vector-db-summary.mjs
```

### **Production Benefits Achieved**

-   **Data Survives**: Container restarts, system reboots, Docker updates
-   **Automated Backups**: Script-based backup system with restore guidance
-   **Visual Management**: OpenSearch Dashboards for data inspection
-   **Zero Data Loss**: Persistent volumes ensure data safety
-   **Development Safe**: `.gitignore` prevents accidental commits of large files
