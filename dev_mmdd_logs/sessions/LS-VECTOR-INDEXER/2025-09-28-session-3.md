# MMDD Session Log: LS-VECTOR-INDEXER

**Session**: 2025-09-28-session-3  
**Work Item**: LS-VECTOR-INDEXER  
**Developer**: Development Team  
**Duration**: TBD  
**TDD Phase**: RED → GREEN (New Feature Implementation)

## 🎯 **Session Objectives**

-   **Primary**: Implement vector database storage for Grade 5 questions
-   **Secondary**: Generate embeddings for semantic search capabilities
-   **Tertiary**: Create batch ingestion system for optimized questions

## 📋 **Session Context**

### **Previous Work Completed** ✅

-   Grade 5 questions with enhanced metadata structure
-   Vector-optimized question format created
-   Individual difficulty fields added to all 90 questions
-   Comprehensive documentation and validation completed

### **Current Challenge**

Need to store the optimized questions (`grade5-questions-vector-ready.json`) into OpenSearch vector database with proper embeddings and indexing.

## 🔍 **Analysis Phase**

### **Current OpenSearch Service Capabilities**

✅ Basic vector storage with 1536-dimensional embeddings  
✅ KNN search functionality  
✅ Difficulty and topic filtering  
✅ Connection testing and health checks

### **Gap Analysis**

❌ **Enhanced Metadata Support**: Current schema doesn't support rich curriculum metadata  
❌ **Batch Ingestion**: No bulk loading for 90 questions  
❌ **Embedding Generation**: No integration with language models  
❌ **Enhanced Search**: Missing support for grade, subject, learning objectives

## 🛠️ **Implementation Plan**

### **Step 1: Enhanced OpenSearch Schema** 🔴 RED

**Objective**: Update index mapping to support enhanced question metadata
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**TDD Phase**: RED (Write failing tests for enhanced schema)

**Required Schema Updates**:

-   Add `grade`, `subject`, `conceptName` fields
-   Support `prerequisites[]` and `learningObjectives[]` arrays
-   Include `gradeLevelStandards` object
-   Add `searchKeywords` and `fullText` fields
-   Support `contentForEmbedding` optimized content

### **Step 2: Embedding Generation Service** 🔴 RED

**Objective**: Create service to generate embeddings from question content
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**TDD Phase**: RED (Write failing tests for embedding generation)

**Implementation Requirements**:

-   Integrate with Ollama/OpenAI for embedding generation
-   Use `contentForEmbedding` field as input
-   Handle batch processing for efficiency
-   Error handling and retry logic

### **Step 3: Batch Ingestion Script** 🔴 RED

**Objective**: Create script to load all 90 questions with embeddings
**Duration**: ~60 minutes  
**TDD Phase**: RED (Write failing tests for batch processing)

**Script Requirements**:

-   Read `grade5-questions-vector-ready.json`
-   Generate embeddings for each question
-   Store with enhanced metadata in OpenSearch
-   Progress tracking and error recovery
-   Validation of successful storage
