# MMDD Session Log - Frontend Question Type Refinement

**Work Item**: TN-FEATURE-REFINE-QUESTION-TYPES-FE  
**Session**: 1  
**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Developer**: Tharanga (with AI assistance)  
**Objective**: Refine frontend question categories and types to accurately match vector database question types

---

## üìã Session Overview

### Context

After successfully implementing prompt refinements for backend question generation (Session 3 of vector-search-enhancement), the focus shifts to frontend alignment. The current frontend `GRADE_TOPICS` mapping in `question.model.ts` does not accurately reflect the actual question types available in the vector database question bank.

### Problem Statement

-   Frontend displays question types that may not exist in the database
-   Question type mappings are inconsistent across grades
-   Categories may not align with actual question bank structure
-   Need accurate mapping based on actual files in `question_bank/` directories

### Success Criteria

-   [ ] Analyze all question bank files (grades 3-8)
-   [ ] Extract actual question types from filenames
-   [ ] Create accurate GRADE_TOPICS mapping
-   [ ] Ensure frontend only shows types that exist in database
-   [ ] Maintain proper grade progression
-   [ ] Document findings for developer review

## üî¥ RED PHASE: Write Failing Test

**Status**: SKIPPED (Data Analysis Task)  
**Rationale**: This is a data analysis and mapping refinement task. No new functionality is being added; we're correcting data mappings to match database reality.

## üìä Analysis: Current vs Actual Question Types

### Step 2: Extract Database Question Type Constants

**Methodology**:

-   Parse filenames to extract type identifiers
-   Convert from snake_case filenames to UPPER_CASE constants
-   Group by grade level
-   Identify patterns and progression

**Extraction Rules**:

```
filename: grade{X}_{type}_questions.json
‚Üí type constant: {TYPE}

Examples:
grade3_addition_questions.json ‚Üí ADDITION
grade6_advanced_fractions_decimals_questions.json ‚Üí ADVANCED_FRACTIONS_DECIMALS
grade8_algebraic_manipulation_questions.json ‚Üí ALGEBRAIC_MANIPULATION
```

## üö® Critical Findings

### Issue 1: Phantom Question Types

Many question types in current frontend mapping **don't exist in the database**:

-   Grade 5: 11 phantom types (69% don't exist!)
-   Grade 7: 18 phantom types (75% don't exist!)
-   Grade 8: 19 phantom types (63% don't exist!)

### Issue 2: Type Name Inconsistencies

Some type names differ between frontend and database:

-   Frontend: `RATIOS_PROPORTIONS` vs Database: `RATIO_PROPORTION` (grade 5)
-   Frontend: `RATIOS_PROPORTIONS` vs Database: `RATIOS_PROPORTIONS` (grade 8)
-   Inconsistent plural forms

### Issue 3: Missing Grade Progression

Current mapping includes types at wrong grade levels or skips grades entirely.

---

## üìã Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Replace GRADE_TOPICS** with accurate mapping based on actual database files
2. **Remove phantom types** that don't exist in database
3. **Fix type name inconsistencies** (singular vs plural)
4. **Validate** that UI only shows available types

### Future Enhancements:

1. **Add validation** to prevent frontend-database mismatches
2. **Create migration plan** for any missing question banks
3. **Document** expected question types per grade in README
4. **Add tests** to verify type mappings match database

## Final Implementation Summary

### Step 3: Update GRADE_TOPICS Mapping ‚úÖ

**Changes**: Replaced entire GRADE_TOPICS (lines 479-559) with accurate database-backed mapping
**Impact**:

-   Grade 3: 6 ‚Üí 5 types (removed SHAPE_PROPERTIES)
-   Grade 4: 10 ‚Üí 10 types (no change, already accurate)
-   Grade 5: 16 ‚Üí 5 types (removed 11 phantom types - 69% reduction!)
-   Grade 6: 13 ‚Üí 13 types (no change, already accurate)
-   Grade 7: 24 ‚Üí 6 types (removed 18 phantom types - 75% reduction!)
-   Grade 8: 30 ‚Üí 11 types (removed 19 phantom types - 63% reduction!)

### Step 4: Update QUESTION_TYPE_DISPLAY_NAMES ‚úÖ

**Changes**: Replaced display name mapping (lines 684-742) with organized, documented version
**Impact**:

-   Removed ~25 phantom types (SIMPLE_RATIOS, EQUIVALENT_RATIOS, AVERAGE_SPEED, etc.)
-   Added category organization (8 categories)
-   Added grade-level comments for each type
-   Fixed inconsistencies (both RATIO_PROPORTION and RATIOS_PROPORTIONS now included)
-   **Result**: 60+ ‚Üí 36 accurate types

### Step 5: Update QUESTION_TYPE_TO_CATEGORY ‚úÖ

**Changes**: Cleaned up category mapping (lines 744-806) to match other mappings
**Impact**:

-   Removed same ~20 phantom types as display names
-   Added grade-level comments per category
-   Ensured consistency with GRADE_TOPICS
-   **Result**: 70+ ‚Üí 50 accurate entries

### Overall Statistics

**Total Phantom Types Removed**: ~60+ entries across all mappings
**Critical Grades Fixed**:

-   Grade 5: 69% phantom rate eliminated
-   Grade 7: 75% phantom rate eliminated
-   Grade 8: 63% phantom rate eliminated

**Consistency Achieved**:

-   GRADE_TOPICS: 50 verified types
-   QUESTION_TYPE_DISPLAY_NAMES: 36 display names (subset for UI)
-   QUESTION_TYPE_TO_CATEGORY: 50 category mappings (matches GRADE_TOPICS)

---

---

## Step 6: Add Grade-Filtered Question Type Helper ‚úÖ

**Objective**: Create helper function to filter question types by both category AND grade level

**Duration**: ~5 minutes

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

### Problem Identified

User noticed that `QUESTION_TYPE_TO_CATEGORY` shows all question types regardless of grade level, causing inappropriate types to appear in the UI (e.g., showing FINANCIAL_LITERACY to grade 3 students).

### Solution Implemented

Added new helper function `getQuestionTypesForCategoryAndGrade(categoryKey: string, grade: number)` that:

1. **Combines Two Mappings**:

    - `GRADE_TOPICS`: What types exist per grade
    - `QUESTION_TYPE_TO_CATEGORY`: How types are categorized

2. **Returns Grade-Appropriate Types**:

    - Only types available for the specified grade
    - Only types matching the specified category
    - Empty array if category not available for that grade

3. **Examples**:

    ```typescript
    // Grade 3 only has basic operations
    getQuestionTypesForCategoryAndGrade("number-operations", 3);
    // Returns: ['ADDITION', 'SUBTRACTION', 'MULTIPLICATION', 'DIVISION']

    // Financial literacy only at grade 8
    getQuestionTypesForCategoryAndGrade("financial-literacy", 5); // Returns: []
    getQuestionTypesForCategoryAndGrade("financial-literacy", 8); // Returns: ['FINANCIAL_LITERACY']
    ```

### Impact

-   **UI Accuracy**: Students only see question types appropriate for their grade
-   **Better UX**: No more "no questions available" errors from selecting unavailable types
-   **Combines Best of Both**: Uses accurate GRADE_TOPICS + organized QUESTION_TYPE_TO_CATEGORY

### Files Modified

-   `learning-hub-frontend/src/app/core/models/question.model.ts` (added ~40 lines after existing helper functions)

---

**Session Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - ALL MAPPINGS + HELPER FUNCTION UPDATED  
**Next Step**: Update Angular components to use `getQuestionTypesForCategoryAndGrade()` instead of `getQuestionTypesForCategory()`  
**Recommendation**: Consider automated validation script to prevent future mismatches
