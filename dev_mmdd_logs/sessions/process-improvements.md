## LESSON LEARNED: Vector Database Ingestion

Date: 2025-10-02
Context: Grade 7 Phase 2 completion

### Issue Identified:
After completing all Grade 7 Phase 2 development (75 questions across 3 sub-phases), the vector database ingestion was overlooked. Only discovered when user pointed out missing data.

### Root Cause:
Development workflow focused on:
1. RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycles ✅
2. Git commits and documentation ✅  
3. Test validation ✅
4. **MISSED: Vector database ingestion** ❌

### Resolution Applied:
- Successfully ingested all Phase 2 datasets:
  - Phase 2A: 25 questions → grade7-multi-unit-conversions-2025
  - Phase 2B: 25 questions → grade7-geometry-spatial-reasoning-2025  
  - Phase 2C: 25 questions → grade7-data-analysis-probability-2025
- Final vector DB status: 2,835 total questions, Grade 7: 435 questions

### Process Improvement:
**NEW WORKFLOW ADDITION**: After each phase completion and before marking complete:
1. Complete TDD cycles (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR) ✅
2. Run comprehensive tests ✅
3. Git commit with documentation ✅
4. **MANDATORY: Ingest into vector database** ⭐ NEW
5. Verify vector database coverage ⭐ NEW
6. Mark phase as complete ✅

### Agent Commitment:
I will proactively include vector database ingestion as a standard part of completion workflows, not wait for user reminders.
