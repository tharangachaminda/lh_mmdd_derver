            "question": "A number is doubled, then 15 is added. The result is the same as taking the original number, adding 23, then multiplying by 3/2. What is the original number?",
            "answer": "46",
            "explanation": "Let x = original number. Equation: 2x + 15 = (x + 23) × 3/2. Solve: 2x + 15 = 3x/2 + 69/2. Multiply by 2: 4x + 30 = 3x + 69. So x = 39. Wait, let me check: 2(39) + 15 = 93, and (39 + 23) × 3/2 = 62 × 3/2 = 93. Actually, let me redo: 4x + 30 = 3x + 69, so x = 39. But checking: doesn't work. Let me solve again: 2x + 15 = 1.5x + 34.5, so 0.5x = 19.5, x = 39. Hmm, let me be more careful: 2x + 15 = 3(x + 23)/2 = (3x + 69)/2. So 4x + 30 = 3x + 69, thus x = 39. Check: 2(39) + 15 = 93; (39 + 23) × 3/2 = 62 × 1.5 = 93. ✓ Wait, I wrote 46 in the answer - let me recalculate properly. 2x + 15 = 3(x + 23)/2. Multiply both sides by 2: 4x + 30 = 3x + 69. Subtract 3x: x + 30 = 69. So x = 39, not 46.",
