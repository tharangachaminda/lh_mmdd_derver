Step 1: Identify all possible outcomes when rolling a die: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} = 6 total outcomes. Step 2: Identify favorable outcomes (rolling a 4): only one way = 1 favorable outcome. Step 3: Calculate probability = favorable outcomes ÷ total outcomes = 1 ÷ 6 = 1/6. This means there's a 1 in 6 chance (about 16.7%) of rolling a 4.",

            "answer": "2/3",
            "explanation": "When calculating probability, we compare favorable outcomes to total possible outcomes. Step 1: Count total balls: 8 red + 4 blue = 12 total balls. Step 2: Count favorable outcomes (red balls): 8 red balls. Step 3: Set up probability fraction: P(red) = 8/12. Step 4: Simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 4: 8 ÷ 4 = 2, 12 ÷ 4 = 3, so 8/12 = 2/3. This means 2 out of every 3 balls drawn will likely be red.",

            "explanation": "In survey data analysis, we collect responses and analyze the total sample size. Step 1: Identify each category's responses: Pizza = 15 students, Burgers = 10 students, Salad = 5 students. Step 2: Add all responses to find total sample size: 15 + 10 + 5 = 30 students.

Step 2: Identify favorable outcome: 1 blue section. Step 3: Calculate probability: P(blue) = favorable outcomes ÷ total outcomes = 1 ÷ 4 = 1/4.

Step 1: Understand deck composition: 52 total cards with 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades). Step 2: Count aces: 1 ace per suit = 4 aces total.

Step 3: Calculate students liking at least one subject using inclusion-exclusion principle: 120 + 80 - 40 = 160 students. We subtract 40 to avoid counting overlap twice.

Step 2: Calculate P(heads on coin flip): P(heads) = 1/2. Step 3: Apply multiplication rule for independent events: Since the dice roll doesn't affect the coin flip, P(sum=7 AND heads) = P(sum=7) × P(heads) = 1/6 × 1/2 = 1/12.

            "answer": "Strong positive correlation; approximately 100",

Step 1: Analyze the correlation pattern: Plot points (2,65), (3,70), (4,75), (5,85), (6,80), (7,90), (8,95). Notice that as study hours increase, test scores generally increase, indicating a positive correlation. Step 2: Assess correlation strength: Most points follow the upward trend closely, with only (6,80) slightly below the pattern. This indicates a strong positive correlation. Step 3: Calculate approximate rate of improvement: From 2 to 8 hours (6-hour increase), scores improved from 65 to 95 (30-point increase). Rate ≈ 30÷6 = 5 points per hour. Step 4: Make prediction: Following the trend, 9 hours = 8 hours (95 points) + 1 hour (5 points) ≈ 100 points. The strong positive correlation suggests that increased study time reliably improves test performance.",

            "answer": "P(Spring)=0.3, P(Summer)=0.4, P(Fall)=0.2, P(Winter)=0.1; Unlikely to occur by chance",
            "explanation": "Probability distributions help us analyze survey results and test whether patterns occur by random chance. Step 1: Create probability distribution from survey data: Total respondents = 300. P(Spring) = 90/300 = 0.30, P(Summer) = 120/300 = 0.40, P(Fall) = 60/300 = 0.20, P(Winter) = 30/300 = 0.10. Step 2: Establish null hypothesis: If no preferences existed, each season would be equally preferred at P = 0.25 (25%). Step 3: Compare observed vs expected: Spring: 0.30 vs 0.25 (+0.05), Summer: 0.40 vs 0.25 (+0.15), Fall: 0.20 vs 0.25 (-0.05), Winter: 0.10 vs 0.25 (-0.15). Step 4: Analyze deviations: Summer shows a large positive deviation (+15 percentage points) and Winter shows a large negative deviation (-15 percentage points). These substantial differences suggest the results are unlikely to occur by random chance alone, indicating genuine seasonal preferences in the population.",

Step 1: Analyze deck composition: Standard deck contains 52 cards with 26 red cards (hearts, diamonds) and 26 black cards (clubs, spades). Step 2: Calculate Player A's probability (2 red cards): First red card: P = 26/52 = 1/2. Second red card (given first was red): P = 25/51. Combined: P(A wins) = (26/52) × (25/51) = 650/2652 = 25/102. Step 3: Calculate Player B's probability (2 black cards): First black card: P = 26/52 = 1/2. Second black card (given first was black): P = 25/51. Combined: P(B wins) = (26/52) × (25/51) = 650/2652 = 25/102. Step 4: Recognize symmetry: Both players have identical probability structures because the deck has equal numbers of red and black cards. This creates a perfectly fair game where neither player has an advantage.",
