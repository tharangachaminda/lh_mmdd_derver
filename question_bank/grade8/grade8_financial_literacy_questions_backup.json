Then use the formula: Time = Interest \u00f7 (Principal \u00d7 Rate) = $210 \u00f7 ($2,000 \u00d7 0.035) = $210 \u00f7 $70 = 3 years.

            "answer": "$1,721",
            "explanation": "Sam's contribution of $1,200 exceeds the maximum for government matching. Therefore, government contribution = $521 (maximum). Total investment = $1,200 + $521 = $1,721.
