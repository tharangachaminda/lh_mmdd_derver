            "question": "A coffee shop's revenue is distributed as follows: 40% from coffee sales, 2/5 from food sales, and the remainder from merchandise. If total daily revenue is $2,400, calculate the dollar amount from each category and express the merchandise sales as both a fraction and percentage of total revenue.",
            "answer": "Coffee: $960, Food: $960, Merchandise: $480, 1/5, 20%",
            "explanation": "Step 1: Calculate coffee sales: 40% × $2,400 = 0.4 × $2,400 = $960. Step 2: Calculate food sales: 2/5 × $2,400 = (2 × $2,400)/5 = $4,800/5 = $960. Step 3: Calculate merchandise sales: $2,400 - $960 - $960 = $480. Step 4: Express merchandise as fraction: $480/$2,400 = 1/5 (dividing by 480). Step 5: Express merchandise as percentage: 1/5 = 0.2 = 20%. Step 6: Verify: 40% + 40% + 20% = 100%. Therefore, coffee and food each generate $960, merchandise generates $480, which represents 1/5 or 20% of total revenue.",
