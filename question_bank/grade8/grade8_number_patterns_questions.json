            "answer": "$2540",
            "explanation": "Step 1: Find the relationship. Week 1: $100, Week 2: $180, Week 3: $340, Week 4: $660. Step 2: Look at ratios and differences. $180/$100=1.8, but $340/$180≠1.8. Try another approach. Step 3: Pattern: 100×2-20=180, 180×2-20=340, 340×2-20=660. Step 4: Rule: multiply by 2 and subtract 20. Week 5: 660×2-20=$1300, Week 6: 1300×2-20=$2540.",

            "explanation": "Step 1: Identify the pattern. Layer 1: 8 tiles, Layer 2: 16 tiles, Layer 3: 24 tiles. Step 2: Find the relationship: 16-8=8, 24-16=8. Each layer adds 8 more tiles. Step 3: This is arithmetic with first term 8 and common difference 8. Step 4: Layer n uses 8n tiles. Layer 10: 8×10=80 tiles. This represents practical mathematical applications in design.",
