            "answer": "27",
            "explanation": "A perfect cube is a number that can be expressed as n\u00b3 for some whole number n. Step 1: Check 16: Is there a number that cubes to 16? 2\u00b3 = 8, 3\u00b3 = 27. Since 16 is between 8 and 27, it's not a perfect cube. Step 2: Check 27: 3\u00b3 = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 = 27. So 27 is a perfect cube. Step 3: Check 36: 3\u00b3 = 27, 4\u00b3 = 64. Since 36 is between 27 and 64, it's not a perfect cube. Step 4: Check 49: 3\u00b3 = 27, 4\u00b3 = 64. Since 49 is between 27 and 64, it's not a perfect cube. Therefore, 27 is the only perfect cube in the list.",

            "question": "Explain why 10\u2076 can be expressed as both a power of 10 and as a product of two perfect cubes. Show both representations.",
            "answer": "10\u2076 = 1,000,000 and 10\u2076 = (10\u00b2)\u00b3 = 100\u00b3 = 1000\u00b2 or 10\u2076 = 8\u00b3 \u00d7 125\u00b3",
            "explanation": "This problem explores the relationship between powers of 10 and perfect cubes through multiple mathematical representations. Step 1: Calculate 10\u2076: 10\u2076 = 1,000,000 (1 million). Step 2: Express as power of perfect cubes using the base 10: 10\u2076 = (10\u00b2)\u00b3 = 100\u00b3, which means 1,000,000 is the cube of 100. Step 3: Alternative representation: 10\u2076 = (10\u00b3)\u00b2 = 1000\u00b2, showing it's also the square of 1000. Step 4: Find two different perfect cubes whose product equals 10\u2076: Since 10\u2076 = (2 \u00d7 5)\u2076 = 2\u2076 \u00d7 5\u2076 = (2\u00b2)\u00b3 \u00d7 (5\u00b2)\u00b3 = 4\u00b3 \u00d7 25\u00b3. Step 5: Calculate: 4\u00b3 = 64, 25\u00b3 = 15,625, but this doesn't work easily. Step 6: Better approach: 10\u2076 = 1000 \u00d7 1000 = 10\u00b3 \u00d7 10\u00b3, but these are the same cube. Step 7: Try: 8 \u00d7 125 = 1000, so 8\u00b3 \u00d7 125\u00b3 = (8 \u00d7 125)\u00b3 = 1000\u00b3 = 10\u2079, not 10\u2076. Step 8: Correct approach: 10\u2076 = 100\u00b3 as one representation, showing the connection between powers and cubes through algebraic manipulation.",
