            "explanation": "A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has exactly two factors: 1 and itself. Step 1: Check if 17 can be divided by any number other than 1 and 17. Step 2: Test divisibility by 2: 17 ÷ 2 = 8.5 (not divisible). Step 3: Test divisibility by 3: 17 ÷ 3 = 5.67 (not divisible). Step 4: Test divisibility by 5: 17 ÷ 5 = 3.4 (not divisible). Step 5: Since we only need to test up to √17 ≈ 4.1, and 17 is not divisible by 2 or 3, it has no factors other than 1 and 17. Therefore, 17 is a prime number.",

Step 2: Find the factors of 2: 2 ÷ 1 = 2, so 1 is a factor. Step 3: 2 ÷ 2 = 1, so 2 is also a factor. Step 4: Check if there are any other factors: no other whole numbers divide evenly into 2.

Step 3: 9 ÷ 3 = 3, so 3 is a factor (and appears twice since 3 × 3 = 9). Step 4: 9 ÷ 9 = 1, so 9 is also a factor. Step 5: The factors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9.

Since 36 is between 27 and 64, it's not a perfect cube. Step 4: Check 49: 3³ = 27, 4³ = 64. Since 49 is between 27 and 64, it's not a perfect cube.

            "explanation": "To determine if 125 is a perfect cube, we need to find if there's a whole number that when cubed equals 125. Step 1: Try small numbers: 1³ = 1, 2³ = 8, 3³ = 27, 4³ = 64. Step 2: Try 5: 5³ = 5 × 5 × 5. Step 3: Calculate: 5 × 5 = 25, then 25 × 5 = 125. Step 4: Therefore, 5³ = 125. Step 5: Since 125 can be expressed as 5³, it is indeed a perfect cube.

Since 23 has no factors other than 1 and 23, it's prime. Step 4: Test 24: 24 = 2³ × 3, so it's composite. Step 5: Test 25: 25 = 5², so it's composite. Step 6: Test 26: 26 = 2 × 13, so it's composite.

Step 9: Test 29: Check divisibility by primes up to √29 ≈ 5.4. 29 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5, so it's prime. Therefore, the prime numbers between 20 and 30 are 23 and 29.",

Step 1: Calculate 10⁶: 10⁶ = 1,000,000 (1 million). Step 2: Express as power of perfect cubes using the base 10: 10⁶ = (10²)³ = 100³, which means 1,000,000 is the cube of 100. Step 3: Alternative representation: 10⁶ = (10³)² = 1000², showing it's also the square of 1000. Step 4: Find two different perfect cubes whose product equals 10⁶: Since 10⁶ = (2 × 5)⁶ = 2⁶ × 5⁶ = (2²)³ × (5²)³ = 4³ × 25³. Step 5: Calculate: 4³ = 64, 25³ = 15,625, but this doesn't work easily. Step 6: Better approach: 10⁶ = 1000 × 1000 = 10³ × 10³, but these are the same cube. Step 7: Try: 8 × 125 = 1000, so 8³ × 125³ = (8 × 125)³ = 1000³ = 10⁹, not 10⁶.
